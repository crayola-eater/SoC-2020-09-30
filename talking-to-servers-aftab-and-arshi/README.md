# Talking To Servers Workshop

## A set of tasks to practice using fetch.

_ALWAYS AWAIT A PROMISE_

### Task 1 - The Fetch Bit

In this task we will fetch some data from a server. The data we receive will be in JSON format and will contain a quote. We will use fetch send a GET request to `https://api.kanye.rest/` and will extract the data from the response object.

ðŸ‘‰ Write an async function call `getQuote`.

ðŸ‘‰ Use fetch to send a GET request to `https://api.kanye.rest/` and store the resolved value of the returned promise in a variable called `response`.

ðŸ‘‰ Call the `.json()` method on the response variable to parse the JSON data contained in the response object. Store the resolved value of the returned promise in a variable called `data`.

ðŸ‘‰ Use that data to set the text of the `h1` with id `"kanye-quote"`.

ðŸ‘‰ Call this function as soon as the page loads

### Task 3 - On Click

Sweet, we are getting a new kanye west quote every time the page is refreshed. Lets make the page more interactive.

ðŸ‘‰ Attach a listener to the button with id `"new-quote-button"` to call `getQuote` when the user clicks.

### Task 4 - History

We are now going to display every quote we fetch in a list so that we don't forget our favorites.

ðŸ‘‰ Create a function that takes in a string, creates a new list item with that string, and adds it to the `ol` with the id `"kanye-quote-history"`

ðŸ‘‰ Call your function within `getQuote`

### Bonus Task!

The quotes we fetch from the API are sometimes repeated.

ðŸ‘‰ Change your code so that if a repeat quote is generated, it will not be added to the list of previous quotes.

#### Bonus Bonus Task!

ðŸ‘‰ Have a quote added to the history list, **only** when a new quote is generated, so that the same quote is never on the screen in two places.
